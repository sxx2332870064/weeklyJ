            Covering multiple aspects of the Internet Art and trying to figure out my final project, the interactions between the fields of video games and art has always been a topic of interest for me, one of the great representative being the game GRIS.
In addition to the art itself, I myself prefers to set up novel game worlds. The gameplay, sound, etc. all have to match up.

            Of course I also feel that the picture quality and the neatness of the game can be extremely shocking, and more attractive when players are fully engaged. However, this answer only involves answering the game's style, that is, the game's picture shaping characteristics, in my opinion more like the game as a carrier to present a beautiful "illustration" or "animation" of the story.

            GRIS, the game, shapes a fantastic world of watercolor illustrations. In this narrative video game, players can traverse a terrain filled with crimson mountains and will see a variety of strange trees with overgrown ruins and other surrealistic landscapes. The game is designed to mimic the way watercolor is rendered on paper, and specks of color can be seen often falling on the protagonist's face or sliding down. Many of the detailed line treatments and soft colors in the game's graphics are an expression of the art of watercolor painting. In this shaped watercolor world, there is no danger or death, only a new world that keeps unraveling.

            Nomada Studio, a game design studio, also speaks: "Nowadays, graphic designers, artists or writers can also be called directors of video games, which shows that the industry is maturing and will provide us with better games in the future." Indeed, I think the development of game design, in addition to the improvement of hardware, there will also be more and more good works of graphic concepts and artistic breakthroughs. These game design teams may not seek to set a lot of puzzles for players, but more to bring players breakthrough new stories or experiences.
